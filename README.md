# Proof of Hodl Demo

This is a demo of an application that scans a QR code for a Stacks wallet, then:

- checks if the user has a balance of MiamiCoin (MIA)
- checks if the user is stacking in the current MiamiCoin (MIA) cycle

If either is true, then the address is a holder of MIA, and a green bar is shown with ACCESS GRANTED.

If both are false, then the address is not a holder of MIA, and a red bar is shown with ACCESS DENIED.
